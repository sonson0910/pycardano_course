=================================================================
SUCCESS - DID UNLOCK WORKING ON CARDANO PREPROD!
=================================================================

PROBLEM SOLVED:
  Root cause: Redeemer Action type was WRONG

  Wrong (was):
    class RegisterAction(PlutusData):
        CONSTR_ID = 0
        action: int   # <- WRONG! Aiken enum has NO fields

  Correct (fixed):
    class Register(PlutusData):
        CONSTR_ID = 0
        # No fields - it's an enum variant

RESULTS:
  DID Creation TX: 4374fa5c17abeb977e008d0568cf1cdf458ce66025ef92871dcbfe2685242149
  Unlock TX:       1519bf1bf1ef5a38ccdf46cba4089e7210288f44dfa1f9d27c294bfa906dd952

  Status: BOTH CONFIRMED ON CHAIN

WHAT THIS MEANS:
  ✓ DID can be created and locked to smart contract
  ✓ Smart contract can be executed (validator returns True)
  ✓ DIDs can be unlocked with valid redeemer
  ✓ Full lifecycle working: Create → Register → Unlock

NEXT STEPS:
  1. Test other redeemer types (Update, Verify, Revoke)
  2. Implement proper validator logic (currently always returns True)
  3. Build full DID lifecycle (create, register, verify, revoke)
  4. Integrate with face recognition backend
  5. Connect to frontend React DApp

FILES UPDATED:
  - unlock_did.py: Fixed redeemer Action enum types
  - did_manager.ak: Validator returns True (proof of concept)
  - create_did.py: Added script to output so it's available on-chain

KEY LEARNING:
  Aiken enum types (like Action) encode as PlutusData with:
  - CONSTR_ID = variant index (0, 1, 2, 3...)
  - NO fields

  Mistake: Sending struct instead of enum variant
  Result: Validator never invoked (ScriptFailures=Namespace() empty)
  Solution: Match Aiken type definition exactly
