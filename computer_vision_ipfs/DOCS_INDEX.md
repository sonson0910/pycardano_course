## 📝 What Changed - Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes
```tsx
File: frontend/src/components/FaceDetector.tsx
├─ Auto-generate DID ID from timestamp + hash
├─ Auto-upload face embedding to IPFS
├─ Auto-create DID on blockchain
└─ Auto-switch to DIDAManagement tab

File: frontend/src/components/DIDAManagement.tsx
├─ Auto-select newly created DID
├─ Auto-fetch DID list
└─ Pre-populate all form fields
```

### Backend Changes
```python
File: backend/app/api/routes.py
├─ Auto-generate DID ID if not provided
├─ Auto-upload to IPFS if needed
├─ Auto-submit real transaction
└─ Return complete response with all hashes
```
