## 💡 The Key Changes (Summary)

### ❌ BEFORE (Problem)
```
Frontend: User types "did:cardano:xyz" manually
Frontend: User copies/pastes IPFS hash manually
Frontend: User switches tabs manually
Frontend: User selects DID manually
Result: Confusing, error-prone, not automated
```

### ✅ AFTER (Solution)
```
Backend: Auto-generates DID ID from hash
Backend: Auto-uploads to IPFS automatically
Frontend: Auto-switches tab on success
Frontend: Auto-selects newly created DID
Result: Zero manual work, pure automation
```

```
Upload JPG → Click [Detect Faces]
→ Shows: "Faces detected: 1"
→ Shows: Confidence score
→ Shows: IPFS hash (auto-generated)
```

✅ **Auto-creation works**
```
Click [Create DID]
→ Shows: DID ID (auto-generated)
→ Shows: TX hash (real blockchain)
→ Auto-switches to "Manage DIDs"
```

✅ **DID management works**
```
Tab switches to "Manage DIDs"
→ Your DID in list (auto-selected)
→ Status shows: "created"
→ Buttons work: [Register] [Update] [Verify] [Revoke]

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Backend won't start
```
Error: "Address already in use"
Solution: Kill process on port 8000
  taskkill /F /IM python.exe
  Then restart
```

### Issue: Frontend won't load
```
Error: "Cannot GET /"
Solution: Check Node.js installed
  node --version
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

### Issue: Face detection fails
```
Error: "Invalid image"
Solution: Use JPG/PNG with clear face
  Bad: Blurry photo, no face
  Good: Clear photo, face visible
```

### Issue: TX fails with error
```
Error: "Insufficient balance"
Solution: Wallet needs test ADA
  Check: Backend logs show wallet balance
  If <1 ADA: Use faucet to get more testnet ADA
```
